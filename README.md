#Scientific Computing with  Python (course)- FreeCodeCamp
## About :
* I'm Learning Python programming and practicinng scientific computing skills .
* This is a beginner project from the FreeCodeCamp "scientific Computing with Python" course, It's the first section of the course focused on building a cipher to learn string manipulation .

## Features/functions :
- Basic Python scripts using many functions to practice the use of strings,for examples : len() , type() , .find() , .lower() , .index() , .isalpha()...and how to declare and call new functions.
- Explore loops : For i in ___ : and  If condition :

## How it was tested : 
Screenshot taken from FreeCodeCamp environment showing the output .

## Learning notes :
This simple project helped me practice Python syntax, problem-soling , and  console output . Thanks to this project or the first section of this course I get to know the Python structure and how the strings used .
